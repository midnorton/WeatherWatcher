# WeatherWatcher
An app/applet to discover which weather service provides the most accurate forcasts for your area.

We used to have a local weather service (wx.ca) that provided a very useful service, especially those of us who chose to ride throughout winter!  In
addition to the values from his own station, he provided on the same page the forecasts from 2 local providors.  Very useful!  On top of that, he would
save the forecasted values for a particular day for preceding 5 days and then, on the forecasted day, provide a graph of what the 2 local services were
predicting for that day over the last 5 days.  I live in Canada in the lee of the Rocky Mountains and the best weather forecast I get, usually, is from
Norway (yr.no).  However, of late, their service has not been so brilliant.  Or at least that is how it appears.  I plan to measure that with this
application.
